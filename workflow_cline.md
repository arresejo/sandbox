Here is the **full workflow** Cline will follow for the request:

> Create me a fully working website for a hairdresser including a reservation system. The stack will be HTML/CSS/Node.JS

---

## 1. **Request Analysis & Planning**

- **Intent recognition:**  
  - Cline understands the user wants a complete website for a hairdresser, with a reservation system, using HTML, CSS, and Node.js.

- **Project scoping:**  
  - Cline plans the required features:
    - Home page, About, Services, Contact, Reservation system (user-facing), Admin panel (for managing reservations), etc.
  - Cline determines the project structure:
    - Backend (Node.js/Express server)
    - Frontend (HTML, CSS, client JavaScript)
    - Data storage (could start with in-memory, JSON, or simple DB setup)

---

## 2. **Project Structure & Boilerplate Generation**

- **Directory structure planning:**  
  - e.g. `hairdresser-website/`
    - `public/` (static files: HTML, CSS, client JS, images)
    - `server/` (Node.js/Express code)
    - `views/` (if using templating engines)
    - `package.json`, `README.md`, etc.

- **File scaffolding:**  
  - Cline generates all starting files using the `write_to_file` tool:
    - Example:
      - `write_to_file` for `package.json` (with dependencies like express, etc.)
      - `write_to_file` for `public/index.html`, `public/styles.css`, etc.
      - `write_to_file` for `server/app.js` (Express app entry point)
      - `write_to_file` for `README.md` (project instructions)

---

## 3. **Feature Implementation**

- **Static Pages:**  
  - Cline generates HTML and CSS for each static page, writing files with `write_to_file`.
  - For templates (if any), Cline generates `.ejs` or similar files.

- **Reservation System (Core Logic):**
  - **Frontend:**  
    - Cline creates a reservation form in HTML.
    - JavaScript for form validation and sending requests to the backend API.
  - **Backend:**  
    - Cline writes Node.js code (using Express) to:
      - Receive reservation requests (`POST /api/reservations`)
      - Store reservations (in memory, file, or set up a DB if needed)
      - Provide admin endpoints to list/manage reservations
    - Writes the logic using `write_to_file` or `replace_in_file` as needed.
  - **Admin Interface:**  
    - Generates HTML/CSS for admin dashboard.
    - Backend endpoints for fetching/updating reservations.

---

## 4. **Iterative Editing & Auto-formatting**

- **Auto-formatting:**  
  - After each file creation/edit, Cline notes that the user’s editor may auto-format code (indentation, semicolons, etc.) and uses the final formatted version for any further edits.

- **Incremental changes:**  
  - For small fixes or targeted changes, Cline uses `replace_in_file` to update code, e.g., updating a function or fixing a typo.

---

## 5. **Dependency and Configuration Management**

- **Dependency installation:**  
  - Cline adds necessary dependencies (like express, body-parser) to `package.json`.
  - May add scripts to `package.json` (`start`, `dev`, etc.).

- **Instructions:**  
  - Updates `README.md` with setup and run instructions (e.g., `npm install`, `npm start`).

---

## 6. **Finalization and Validation**

- **Review:**  
  - Cline reviews the generated project structure to ensure all parts (frontend, backend, reservation system) are present.
- **Testing (if requested):**  
  - Optionally, Cline may generate test files or instructions for manual testing.

---

## 7. **User Feedback & Iteration**

- **Completion:**  
  - Cline presents the generated project to the user.
- **Follow-ups:**  
  - Waits for user feedback (e.g., “Change color scheme”, “Add email confirmation”).
  - Uses `write_to_file` or `replace_in_file` for any further requested changes.

## **Summary Table**

| Step                  | Tool Used         | Example Output                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Directory & File Gen. | `write_to_file`  | `public/index.html`, `server/app.js`, ...      |
| Boilerplate/code      | `write_to_file`  | Package.json, HTML, CSS, JS files              |
| Targeted edits        | `replace_in_file`| Update functions, fix bugs, adjust UI          |
| User instructions     | `write_to_file`  | README.md                                      |

**In summary:**  
Cline plans, scaffolds, codes, formats, and iterates—all using specialized file tools and in a logical, automated workflow—until a working hairdresser website with a reservation system is ready, following best practices for Node.js web development.
