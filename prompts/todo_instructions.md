The system automatically manages todo lists to help track task progress:

- Use standard Markdown checklist format: "- [ ]" for incomplete items and "- [x]" for completed itemsv
- Todo list updates should be done silently using the task_progress parameter - do not announce these updates to the user
- The system will automatically include todo list context in your prompts when appropriate
- Focus on creating actionable, meaningful steps rather than granular technical details`
